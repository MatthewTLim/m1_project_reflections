You will need to copy this markdown, create your own **private** gist, and paste this markdown in your own gist. After each project, you will take time to come back to your private gist and answer each of the questions that are outlined for you below. 

# M1 Project Reflections

## Warmup Project 

### Project Overview

#### List out the tools you used:
1. Ruby Docs
2. Google
3. Stack Overflow
...

#### Write a 1-2 sentence synopsis of what this project does:

### Reflection Questions: 
**1. How do you approach solving something when you don’t have all the information?**<br />
I first will try going into pry to see exactly what is wrong if I can figure out a direction to go from here I will typically check ruby docs or google for a solution. If that does not work I usually will look at stack over flow for similiar issues that I am having.
**2. What was your most effective strategy for getting through blockers during this project? How did this help your process?**<br />
The most effective way tog et through blockers for me on this project was to take breaks often and use resources such as cohort mates and rock/mentor
**3. Tell us about a time that you found yourself in an unproductive struggle, how did you get out of it?**<br />
I was having some issues with one method so I took a walk and came back once i came back I had a fresh view ov the project and was able to figure out a solution.
**4. What was the benefit of using TDD while building out this project?**<br />
The benefit of TDD was that it layed the bluepront for what my method could look like as well as what functions it would have to have . TDD essentially guides us to where we need to be.

## First Solo

### Project Overview

#### List out the tools you used:
1. Google
2. Youtube
3. chatgpt
...

#### Write a 1-2 sentence synopsis of what this project does:

### Reflection Questions: 
**1. Pick 1 technical concept you used for this project (look back at our lessons and the learning goals of the project to pick this).
The biggest part of this project for me was using loops such as until and while we also used conditional statements a good bit on this project
Explain what this concept is, how it works, and give an example of where you used this in your code.**<br />
looping is when you set a condition that needs to be met you then iterate or loop through the data until that condition is or isnt met. This allows us to set up things such as counters to get the desired results.
**2. What was your process when you got stuck?**<br />
wehn I got stuck I would keep watching the linked list videos I found on youtube as they were very informative. This time instead of using stackoverflow I used chatgpt but limited myself to questions such as is x y z possible in ruby or can i have to while loops wihtin a method. This helped me quickly learn about the tools we were using to do linked list. Finally if neither of these sources solved my issue I reached out to my cohort mate.
**3. If you had to do this project again, what would you do differently and why?**<br />

I wouuld like to go back and have a bit more time to refactor my code. I also would improve my gitworkflow as it was nonexistent on this project.
